    "text": "In a quiet forest, a tortoise and a hare decided to race. The hare sprinted quickly and soon felt confident he would win. He stopped to rest under a tree and fell asleep. The tortoise kept moving slowly but steadily. When the hare finally woke up, he ran to the finish line, but the tortoise had already crossed it. The animals learned that steady effort can beat careless speed."

    "text": "Rain forms when tiny drops of water in clouds join together. When the drops become heavy, they fall as rain. People measure rain with a tool called a rain gauge. If the air is cold enough, the drops freeze and fall as snow instead. Weather scientists, called meteorologists, collect this data to make forecasts."
